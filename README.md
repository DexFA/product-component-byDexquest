## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Had some challenges with keeping the content on the right hand side inside its container (white background)
So after researching I realized that all I needed to do was to change my height settings to auto

```css
.product-container {
  height: auto;
}
```
This worked like magic and made me learn to be careful when defining heights in CSS cos things could easily start getting messed up.

Part of the challenge I couldn't solve was how to get the image section to maintain the same height with the product container section as the viewport is being scaled down.
If anyone could help me with this I'd really appreciate it.

### Continued development

I plan to take on more challenges to strengthen my HTML & CSS skills.
